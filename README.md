Check Domain Name Availability


In this file you will get the PHP script for checking the domain Name Availability. If you want to check the availability of other TLDs then just change the value, for example instead of .com you want to check .info then just replace the value in .com to .info in PHP script and you can modify the same in html body part for showing the .info value instead of .com.


Thanks!
